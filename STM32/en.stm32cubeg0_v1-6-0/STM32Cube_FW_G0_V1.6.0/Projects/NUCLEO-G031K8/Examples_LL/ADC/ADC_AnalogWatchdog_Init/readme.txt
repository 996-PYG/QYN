@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral with an ADC analog watchdog to monitor a channel 
and detect when the corresponding conversion data is outside the window 
thresholds.
This example is based on the STM32G0xx ADC LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
Analog watchdog is configured to monitor all channels on group regular
(therefore, including the selected channel), 
low threshold is set to 0V and high threshold is set to Vdda/2.
ADC interruption enabled: Analog watchdog 1.

Example execution:
From the main program execution, the ADC converts the selected channel continuously.
When conversion data is out of analog watchdog window, ADC interruption occurs.
Into analog watchdog callback function, a status variable is set
and LED3 is updated.
LED3 state:
 - LED remains turned-off if voltage is within AWD window (analog watchdog not triggered)
 - LED turned-on if voltage is out of AWD window
At each connection between PA.15 (Arduino D2) and GND (using jumper),
the ADC analog watchdog is rearmed to be ready for another trig.

LED3 is blinking every 1 sec in case of error.

Note: In case of noise on voltage applied on ADC channel input (due to connectors and wires parasitics),
      ADC analog watchdog may trig at a voltage level with an uncertainty of tens of mV.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "ubAnalogWatchdog1Status": analog watchdog state

Connection needed: use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect 
it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for PA.15 (Arduino D2)
  1 GPIO for LED3
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Connector CN4 pin 10, Arduino pin A2)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G031K8Tx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G031K8 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
