@par Example Description

How to enter the STOP 0 mode.

After start-up LED3 is toggling during 5 seconds, then the system automatically 
enter in STOP 0 mode (Final state).

LED3 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED3 toggling : system in RUN mode
 - LED3 off : system in STOP 0 mode

@note To measure the current consumption in STOP0 mode, remove JP1 jumper 
      and connect an ampere meter to JP1 to measure IDD current.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M0+ core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.
