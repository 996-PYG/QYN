@par Example Description

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to generate a timebase. This 
example is based on the STM32G0xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size). 

In this example TIM1 input clock TIM1CLK is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),   
   since APB1 pre-scaler is equal to 1.
      TIM1CLK = PCLK1
      PCLK1 = HCLK
      => TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock (64 MHz)

To set the TIM1 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 64 MHz for STM32G0xx Devices.

The auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a timebase period of 100ms,
meaning that initial timebase frequency is 10 Hz.
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / timebase frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / 10) - 1

Update interrupts are enabled. Within the update interrupt service routine, pin LED3
(connected to LED3 on board NUCLEO-G031K8) is toggled. So the period of
blinking of LED3 = 2 * timebase period.

Put and remove a jumper between PA.15 (Arduino D2) and GND to update the
autoreload register (ARR). In up-counting update event is generated  at each counter overflow
(when the counter reaches the auto-reload value).

Finally the timebase frequency is calculated as follows:
timebase frequency = TIM1 counter clock /((PSC + 1)*(ARR + 1)*(RCR + 1))
