@par Example Description 

How to perform I2C data buffer transmission/reception between 
one master and two slaves with different address sizes (7-bit or 10-bit). This example 
uses the STM32G0xx I2C HAL and LL API (LL API usage for performance improvement)
and an interrupt.

Board: NUCLEO-G031K8 (embeds a STM32G031K8 device)
SCL MASTER Pin:PB8 (CN3, pin11 (D8))
SDA MASTER Pin:PB9 (CN3, pin13 (D10))

SCL SLAVE Pin: PA11 (CN4, pin7 (A5))
SDA SLAVE Pin: PA12 (CN4, pin8 (A4))

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 64 MHz.

The I2C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I2C_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_I2C_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed I2C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO and NVIC). You may update this function to change I2C configuration.

The user can disable internal pull-up by opening ioc file.
For that, user can follow the procedure :
1- Double click on the I2C_OneBoard_ComSlave7_10bits_IT.ioc file
2- When CUBEMX tool is opened, select System Core category
3- Then in the configuration of GPIO/I2C1, change Pull-up to No pull-up and no pull-down for the both pins
4- Same action in the configuration of GPIO/I2C2, change Pull-up to No pull-up and no pull-down for the both pins
5- Last step, generate new code thanks to button "GENERATE CODE"
The example is updated with no pull on each pin used for I2C communication


For this example two buffers are used 
- aTxBuffer buffer contains the data to be transmitted 
- aRxBuffer buffer is used to save the received data
Note that both buffers have same size
                       
Example execution:
First step, put and remove a jumper between PA.15 (Arduino D2) and GND,
this action initiates a reception process (aRxBuffer) for
I2C Slave1 or Slave2 address through HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_IT().
Then I2C Master starts the communication by sending aTxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT()
for Slave1 (10-Bit address). 
The end of this step is monitored through the HAL_I2C_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aTxBuffer and aRxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.
Toggle LED3 when data is received correctly, otherwise LED3 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period)
Second step, put and remove a jumper between PA.15 (Arduino D2) and GND,
this action initiates a transmission process (aTxBuffer) for
I2C Slave1 or Slave2 address through HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_IT().
Then I2C Master starts the communication by receiving aRxBuffer through HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT()
from Slave2 (7-Bit address).
The end of this two steps are monitored through the HAL_I2C_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aTxBuffer and aRxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.
Toggle LED3 when data is received correctly, otherwise LED3 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period)

@note In Master side, only Acknowledge failure error is handled. When this error
       occurs Master restart the current operation until Slave acknowledges it's
       address.
        
@note I2C1 and I2C2 instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
       file depending hardware configuration used.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G031xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G031K8 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  -NUCLEO-G031K8 Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to I2C2 SCL/SDA (PA11 and PA12)
    to respectively SCL and SDA pins of I2C1 (PB8 and PB9).
      - I2C2_SCL  PA11(CN4, pin7 (A5)) : connected to I2C1_SCL PB8(CN3, pin11 (D8))
      - I2C2_SDA  PA12(CN4, pin8 (A4)) : connected to I2C1_SDA PB9(CN3, pin13 (D10))

  - Launch the program.
  - Put and remove a jumper between PA.15 (Arduino D2) and GND to initiate a write request by Master
    then Slave1 (10-Bit address) receive a Buffer. LED3 Toggle when data is received correctly.
  - Put and remove a jumper between PA.15 (Arduino D2) and GND to initiate a read request by Master
    then Slave2 (7-Bit address) Transmit a Buffer. LED3 Toggle when data is received correctly.

@par How to use it ?
