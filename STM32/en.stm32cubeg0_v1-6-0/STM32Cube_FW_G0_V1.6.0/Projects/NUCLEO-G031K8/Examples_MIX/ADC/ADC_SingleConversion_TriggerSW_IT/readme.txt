@par Example Description

How to use the ADC to perform a single ADC channel conversion at each 
software start. This example uses the interrupt programming model (for 
polling and DMA programming models, please refer to other examples). It is 
based on the STM32G0xx ADC HAL and LL API. The LL API is used 
for performance improvement.

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC interruption enabled: EOC (end of conversion of ADC group regular).

Example execution:
At start-up, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel.
When conversion is completed, ADC interruption occurs.
IRQ handler callback function reads conversion data from ADC data register
and stores it into a variable, LED3 is turned on.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

 LED3 toggle each 500 ms if any errors was occurred .
 
Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (connector CN4  pin 10 (Arduino A2))
